## About me
Your average high schooler! When I don't study, I research and build cool software products. Sometimes I do freelancing work for other companies, the most recent of which included writing a custom data processing solution. Most of my repositories are private due to the nature of the codebases (e.g. company property or unfinished functionality), and they usually stay that way. :-)

## Current projects
Exploring the alternatives to browser-based apps and delving deeper into system-level programming. I'm playing around with WinAPI to achieve performant and lossless HiFi playback, and experimenting with Flutter to provide a snappy, clean, and lightweight user experience. Here are a couple of my way-too-many concurrent projects, excluding paid work:
- **Harmoni** - A lightweight HiFi music player that supports lossless streaming through WASAPI of FLAC, WAV, and more.
- **Nest** - An app to automatically sort & organize pictures according to their EXIF data.
- **Swirve** - A modern game server management panel that incorporates many features in a lightweight app.
- **Sekure** - A cryptographic library in Rust that aims to simplify writing safe & encrypted files.
